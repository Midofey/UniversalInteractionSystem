<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>The Universal Interaction System is a flexible, actor-based interaction framework that gives players the ability to interact with any object in your world using a unified workflow.
It supports everything from simple “press to interact” prompts to complex multi-step interactions and custom logic.
With a configurable setup and modular design, it helps you create consistent, intuitive interactions across all gameplay elements, without rewriting your logic for each new object.</p>
